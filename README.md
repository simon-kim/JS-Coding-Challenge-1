JS-Coding-Challenge-1
=====================

Use object-oriented JavaScript to model a public library (w/ three classes: Library, Shelf, &amp; Book).

The library should be aware of a number of shelves. Each shelf should know what books it contains. Make the book object have "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods that control what shelf the book is sitting on. The library should have a method to report all books it contains. In addition to pushing this .js file to your Github account, please also setup a http://jsfiddle.net/ with the solution and enter the saved URL here so we can take a look.
